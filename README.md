Rfunctions
==========

R custom functions that are useful for different omics analyses.

## `Rfunctions.R`

Script that loads all the functions by doing source of the other R scripts present in this repository.

It use the R package `here` (if you don't have it, it will probably be installed).

Paths may have to be changed depending on the current directory where `here` works.

## `chromReads.R`

### `chromReads()`

Takes the `bam` files and counts the aligned reads in each chromosome and then plots a bar graph.
Note that this function won't count nor plot the reads aligned to strange (i.e. *unknown* or *random*) chromosomes.

Packages used:

* `Rsamtools`
* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`

## `pcaplot2.R`

### `pcaplot2()`

It is a modification of the function `pcaplot` from R package `pcaExplorer` that allows to change points shapes.

It takes rlog-transformed DEseq2 dataframe as input. 

Packages used:

* `ggplot2`


## `pieAnno2.R`

It includes two functions:
	
### `filterAnno2()`

Takes the output of `annotatePeak` function from `ChIPseeker` package and changes the annotation features to "Promoter" and "Distal". 

### `pieAnno2()` 

Takes the output of `annotatePeak`, calls `filterAnno2` and plots a ggplot2-based pie chart with only distal and promoter features.

Packages used:

* `ggplot2`

## `pieAnno3.R`

It includes two functions:
	
### `filterAnno3`

Takes the output of ï¿½`annotatePeak and changes the annotation features to "Promoter", "Gene body" or "Distal". 

### `pieAnno3`

Takes the output of `annotaePeak`, calls `filterAnno3` and plots a ggplot2-based pie chart with only distal, promoter and gene body regions. 

Packages used:

* `ggplot2`

## `volcanoplot2.R`

### `volcanoPlot2`

Modification of a function made by dfernandezperez in his RNAseq_snakemake pipeline.

Needs the output of DESeq2 analysis after calling de DEGs in the corresponding contrast. Must have an extra "DEG" column with the genes "Downregulated", "Upregulated" or "NotDE". 

`ggplot2`-based function that draws a volcanoplot with the output of a DESeq analysis. 

Takes the points that are outside of the graph limits and draw them as a triangle at the borders.

Optionally: Draws the labels of the DEGs with lower adjusted p-value and higher using `ggrepl`.

Optionally: Instead of using `geom_point()`, uses `geom_point_rast()` from `ggrastr`.

Packages used:

* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`
* `ggrastr` (optional)
* `ggrepel` (optional)
